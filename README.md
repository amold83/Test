# NH EASY 
 NH EASY, is New Hampshire DHHS's IE&E portal, designed and developed by Deloitte. This repository contains the code base for two of NH EASY's signature modules: 
 Gateway to Services: The Gateway contains functionality for users to conduct account management, check their benefits, upload documents, view notices, access the Provider Portal, as well as determine Presumptive Eligibility.
 Application for Services: The application itself features a responsive design, streamlined questions, and user-friendly forms. Overarchingly, the application was designed to not be overwhelming, as large-scale federal applications often can be. Human-centric designed guided design of the application, aiming to make it as intuitive and seamless of an experience as possible.

# Design Goals 
When first designed and implemented, NH EASY aimed to enable a “bricks to clicks” transition for New Hampshire. Initial project goals were to implement NH EASY and incrementally the gateway and application throughout the lifecycle of the portal. 

# Development methodology
Developing NH EASY occurred in an Agile manner, beginning with requirement collection during a Discovery Sprint 0. We conducted subsequent and iterative user research, prototyping, and screen building. These screens were then improved upon and eventually modernized throughout future sprints and efforts. NH EASY was designed from a technical perspective with a propensity for Agile, “learn fast, fail fast” mentality and open-source technologies. With agile development, we prioritized features that delivered immediate, high-impact value to the customer. In the spirit of increasing efficiency and reducing future rework, we parsed functionality into small components that are easily interchangeable and recyclable. We focused on solutioning user-friendly features, and placed our efforts in responsiveness, look and feel, and user experience, as opposed to flashy fonts or unnecessary features. 

#Features
The solution is fully 508 compliant, and we conduct scheduled comprehensive security scans to identify and resolve any vulnerabilities.
Its over 120 distinct pages allow for functionality to be nuanced and compartmentalized enough to respond to user desires and provide an enhanced user experience, while ultimately comprising of the same base framework that allows for continuous iterative, incremental modernization.


#Awards
The resulting application remains modernized with the latest open-source technologies available. NH EASY won a “Best Fit Integrator” award and is a national leader in self-service portals and real-time eligibility determination.
